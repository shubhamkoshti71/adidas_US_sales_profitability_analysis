# Adidas Sales and Profitability Analysis

## Project Overview
This Tableau project provides an extensive analysis of Adidas' sales and profitability across different regions, sales methods, and product categories. It offers insights into the factors affecting sales performance and operational efficiency for Adidas products, particularly focusing on the Northeast region of the United States.

## Visualizations
The project includes a series of detailed visualizations that showcase various aspects of Adidas' sales strategy:

- **Dashboard 1**: Compares sales by product category and sales method, illustrating the relationship between product prices and sales volumes.
- **Dashboard 2**: Focuses on regional sales performance, comparing total sales and operating profits across different sales methods and regions.
- **Story**: Highlights the specific challenges and opportunities in the Northeast region, providing a narrative on how different sales methods impact profitability.

## Insights and Recommendations
- **Increased Focus on Walmart**: Given Walmartâ€™s high sales and operating profit in the Northeast, increasing focus on this retailer could enhance regional performance.
- **Boosting Online Sales**: Promoting online platforms and digital marketing in the Northeast can address the region's lower online sales and improve overall profitability.
- **Digital Marketing Strategies**: Leveraging digital marketing to better engage customers and drive online sales, particularly through social media campaigns and targeted promotions.

## Usage
The dashboards are interactive and allow users to filter data by year (2020 and 2021) and region (Midwest, Northeast, South, Southeast, West) to analyze specific sales dynamics. This functionality helps in understanding temporal trends and regional differences in sales and profitability.
